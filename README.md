# MovieFinder
A Spring Boot application that provides a REST API to find information on movies. The movie data is accessed using the [OMDb REST API] (http://omdbapi.com/).

* The `findMovie` call uses Apache Camel to manage the processing of a request to find a movie.
* The `findMovieRx` call uses RxJava to manage the processing of a request to find a movie. (TODO)
